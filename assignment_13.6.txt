1. What kind of data Hbase can store:
    * The data stored in HBase is of two kinds:
         -> Row-oriented data stores 
              - Data is stored and retrieved one row at a time and hence could read unnecessary data if only some of the data in a row is required
              - Easy to read and write records
              - Well suited for OLTP systems
         -> Column-oriented data stores 
              - Data is stored and retrieved in columns and hence can read only relevant data if only some data is required
              - Read and Write are typically slower operations
              - Well suited for OLAP systems

2. Explain the important terms in hbase architecture:
     * HBase Master Server
          - Master server assigns region to region server with the help of Apache Zookeeper
          - It is also responsible for load balancing
     * HBase Regions
          - HBase tables are divided horizontally into row-key range called “regions” and are managed by region server
          - So regions are nothing bit the tables that are split horizontally into regions
          - Regions are assigned to a node in the cluster called Region server
     * HBase Region Server
          - Region server manages regions and runs on HDFS DataNodes
          - It communicates with the client and handles data-related operation
          - Decide the size of the region
          - Handle the read and write request for all the regions under it 
     * HBase MemStore
          - HBase memstore is like the cache memory
          - When we want to write anything to HBase, first it is getting stores in memstore          
     * HBase Hfiles
          - As said, whenever any data is being written into HBase, first that gets written into memstore
          - And when memstore accumulates enough data, the entire sorted key-value set is written into a new Hfiles in HDFS
          - The write into HFile is sequential and is very fast
     * Zookeeper
          - HBase uses Zookeeper as a coordinator service to maintain the server state in the cluster
          - It tells which servers are alive and available and also provides server failure notification
          
3. What is zookeeper? What happens if the zookeeper service is stopped:
   Zookeeper:
     * ZooKeeper is a distributed co-ordination service to manage large set of hosts
     * Co-ordinating and managing a service in a distributed environment is a complicated process
     * ZooKeeper solves this issue with its simple architecture and API
     * ZooKeeper allows developers to focus on core application logic without worrying about the distributed nature of the application

4. Is it necessary that region server be located on all DataNodes:
     * YES , it is necessary thae region server to be located on all datanodes

5. How will you implement joins in Hbase:
     * Either load data in HIVE and design hive queries or develop map reduce application to perform join
